You can use the simulator at the given address.

## For whom is it intended?

This simulator was developed for teachers who teach programming.

Suppose you are a teacher instructing programming and want to teach your students about the concept of recursive calls. You might want them to solve the famous puzzle '[Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)', which utilizes the idea of recursion. However, while you can teach the concept of the Tower of Hanoi, it might be challenging to make the class appealing to students who are just beginning to learn programming, as replicating the movement of discs in the Tower of Hanoi on a screen requires extensive knowledge beyond just recursion.

This 'Hanoi Simulator' is a program that moves the discs of the 'Tower of Hanoi' according to given instructions. The simulator itself does not have the functionality to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. (However, it does come with initial instructions to move three discs.) You will have your students write a program that outputs instructions for moving the discs in the Tower of Hanoi. Then, by executing these outputs in this simulator, you can visually confirm through animation whether the 'Tower of Hanoi' has been solved correctly.
